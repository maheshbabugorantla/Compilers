## STEP 4 CODE

### The Task: The Compiler's semantic routines for expressions and I/O operations

<p>Your goal in this step is to generate executable code for a simple program written using your language (a program that only has the main function, which calls no other functions). For simplicity reasons, the code that my compiler will generate is meant to be executed on the Tiny Simulator.</p>

#### (1) Generate an intermediate representation (IR):

#### (2) The Tiny Simulator

#### (3) Code Generation

Please put your antlr.jar file in "lib" directory 
and submit it with other files.

The provided Makefile is for ANTLR v4,
Please edit your own Makefile if you're using v3 or something else.

Edit the Makefile with actual group member names.

Micro.g4 is the grammar file that you should edit and Micro.java will be your main java program after you edit it.
